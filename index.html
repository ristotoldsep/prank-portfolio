        <h2>📜 About our friendship</h2>
        <p>
          Oliver Reinaas had been selling books with Southwestern Advantage in differents states in the US for three summers and
          found himself in an interesting situation when the first wave of Covid-19 hit. The work and travel program to sell books
          was cancelled and he was leading a sales team back in Estonia.
        </p>
    
        <p>
        After that he realized that there must be some form of sales you can do that isn’t heavily affected by the virus and can
        be done anywhere. With these thoughts in mind he stumbled into his old classmate – <u><strong>Arnold Oksmaa</strong></u>.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          He found out that Arnold had been strip dancing in Estonia for several years and already had knowledge in the field, as
          well as a good network of people. And that’s when the ideas clicked – why don’t we combine the sales and leadership
          together with the technical knowledge and start up a new company selling dance shows?
        </p>

        <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Friendship at first sight</h2>
    
        <p>
        Oliver quickly found that there is a big gap in the market and that most companies providing this service were missing
        something – sales and customer communication. That was the main reason behind vDisain’s success: our approach. With
        Oliver’s experience in sales and managing sales people the team and revenue grew rapidly and in just six months we were
        bigger than an average web development company that had been around for 10+ years.
        </p>
    
        <h2>🏆 Friends forever</h2>
    
        <p>
          The thought of expanding to US came pretty naturally: half of the team have done sales in the US and after a brief
          market research we saw that compared to Estonia, the US had a far bigger gap in the same market. That’s when we set out
          to take our experience, our quality and provide the same level of service in the USA.
